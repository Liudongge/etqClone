# etqClone

This is the second project I worked on at DevMountain Coding Bootcamp.

I decided to make a full stack ecommerce website, which is a clone of etq-amsterdam.com. This is my very first full stack project.

I decided to use Angular for this single page application with the help of Angular-animate plus Jquery for the animations. 

My goal was to create a fully operational online store with minimalistic design and a fluid, intuitive user experience, aimed for mobile devices. 

## Getting Started

Instructions: 
- This website is best viewed with a mobile device.
- Select a shoe. Select a size. Add to cart. Keep shopping or go to checkout.

This application is hosted on my Digital Ocean droplet @  http://etqclone.site/

### Design

Design focused towards an intuitive and ergonomic user experience, where the user can add shoes to the cart with ease. This app works in full screen mode, but was primarily designed for mobile.

### MVP and Summary

Minimum viable product:
- Full stack ecommerce site
- Functional shopping cart
- Intuitive User Experience

This project was very fun. It gave me perspective on what it's like to make a full stand-alone product. I really enjoyed moving data from front to back. My biggest challenge was understanding how to make well written endpoints. Another challenge was learning how not to spend too much time on css. This was a great project and it also made me want to go buy a pair of shoes.
